InternetView is an Internet Interviewing platform. It connects job applicants and employers together quickly. Rather than providing too much information to recruiters. We simply provide the ability to upload a resume/cover letter to communicate a potential hires ability. Applicants are able to view current job postings and subsequently apply to them. Upon receiving applications recruiters may schedule a meeting time to complete a video interview.
